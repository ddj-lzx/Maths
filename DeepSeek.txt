Part I – The Mirage of Integrals

For each non-negative integer n, define:
A_n = 4 ∫_0^∞ t^{2n} e^{-t/2} cos( (√3/2) t ) dt

Consider the function f(x) given by the power series:
f(x) = ∑_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n (A_n / (2n)!) x^{2n}

1. Show that A_n = 4 (2n)! cos((2n+1)π/3).

2. Determine the closed-form expression for f(x) by two distinct methods:
   a) Express the series as the real part of a geometric series in the complex plane;
   b) Derive and solve an ordinary differential equation satisfied by f(x).

3. Evaluate the definite integral:
   K = ∫_0^∞ f(x) dx
   Verify your result using at least two different approaches (e.g., partial fractions, contour integration, Fourier transforms).

Part II – The Quintic Spring

Let K be the constant obtained in Part I. Find the unique real solution y of the quintic equation:
y^5 + 5y^3 + 5y = 2π / K
Provide the exact value of y expressed in radicals.

This problem is completely original. Multiple solution paths exist; none is proclaimed optimal.
