Problem: The Phantom Resonance & The Quintic Mirror

Description:
This problem explores the hidden connections between analytic continuations, 
integral transforms, and the algebraic structures of higher-degree equations. 
The solver is encouraged to seek intuitive shortcuts before applying 
rigorous proofs.

Part I: The Integral Summation

Let A_n be a sequence defined by the integral:
    A_n = ∫₀^∞ (t^{2n}) * e^{-t} * cos(t) dt,  for n = 0, 1, 2, ...

Consider the function f(x) defined by the infinite series:
    f(x) = ∑_{n=0}^∞ [(-1)^n * A_n / (2n)!] * x^{2n}

1. Identify the closed-form rational expression for f(x).
2. Prove that the value of the definite integral of this function over 
   the positive real line is:
    K = ∫₀^∞ f(x) dx = π/2

(Hint: Consider the complex representation of the integrand and the 
geometric series in the complex plane.)

Part II: The Quintic Descent

Using the constant K = π/2 derived in Part I, find the unique real 
solution y to the following quintic equation:
    y^5 + 5y^3 + 5y = 2π / K

Provide the exact form of y involving radicals.
